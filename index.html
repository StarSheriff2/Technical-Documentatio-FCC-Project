      <p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during 
        software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it 
        can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data 
        integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Introduction_to_Github_workflow">
      <header><h1>Introduction to Github workflow</h1></header>
      <p>The guide assumes you already understand what Git is and what it's used for, know the basic 
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows">workflow</a>: how to 
        create a repository using <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>Github</strong></a>, clone it to your 
        local machine directory, add files to staging area, commit changes and push them back to your remote 
        repository.</p>
      <p>The core idea behind the <strong>Feature Branch Workflow</strong> is that all feature development should take 
        place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy 
        for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. 
        It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for 
        continuous integration environments.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="How_it_works">
      <header><h1>How it works</h1></header>
      <p>The <strong>Feature Branch Workflow</strong> assumes a central repository, and <i>master</i> represents the 
        official project history. Instead of committing directly on their local master branch, 
        developers create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature. Feature branches 
        should have descriptive names, like animated-menu-items or issue-#1061. The idea is to give 
        a clear, highly-focused purpose to each branch.</p>
      <p>In addition, feature branches can (and should) be pushed to the central repository. This 
        makes it possible to share a feature with other developers without touching any official 
        code. Since <i>master</i> is the only “special” branch, storing several feature branches on the 
        central repository doesn’t pose any problems. Of course, this is also a convenient way to 
        back up everybody’s local commits. The following is a walk-through of the <strong>life-cycle of a 
        feature branch</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Start_with_the_master_branch">
      <header><h1>Start with the master branch</h1></header>
      <p>All feature branches are created off the latest code state of a project. This guide assumes 
        this is maintained and updated in the <i>master</i> branch.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code> 
            git checkout master</code></li>
          <li><code> 
            git fetch origin</code></li>
          <li><code> 
            git reset --hard origin/master</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p>This switches the repo to the master branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's 
        local copy of master to match the latest version.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Create_a_new-branch">
      <header><h1>Create a new-branch</h1></header>
      <p>Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on. After creating a branch, check 
        it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.</p>
      <code>&nbsp git checkout -b new-feature</code>
      <p>This checks out a branch called new-feature based on master, and the -b flag tells Git to 
        create the branch if it doesn’t already exist.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Update_add_commit_and_push_changes">
      <header><h1>Update, add, commit, and push changes</h1></header>
      <p>On this branch, edit, stage, and commit changes in the usual fashion, building up the 
        feature with as many commits as necessary. Work on the feature and make commits like you 
        would any time you use Git.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code> 
          git status</code></li>
        <li><code> 
          git add</code></li>
        <li><code> 
          git commit</code></li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Push_feature_branch_to_remote">
      <header><h1>Push feature branch to remote</h1></header>
      <p>t’s a good idea to push the feature branch up to the <i>central repository</i>. This 
        serves as a convenient backup, when collaborating with other developers. This would give 
        them access to view commits to the new branch.</p>
      <code>&nbsp git push -u origin new-feature</code>
      <p>This command pushes <i>new-feature</i> to the central repository (origin), and the 
        <code>-u</code> flag adds it as a remote tracking branch. After setting up the tracking 
        branch, <code>git push</code> can be invoked without any parameters to automatically 
        push the new-feature branch to the central repository.</p>
      <p>To get feedback on the new feature branch, create a 
        <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Pull-Request-on-Github"><i>pull request</i></a> 
        in <strong>Github</strong>. From there, you can add reviewers and make sure everything 
        is good to go before merging.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Resolve_feedback">
      <header><h1>Resolve feedback</h1></header>
      <p>Now teammates comment and approve the <i>pushed commits</i>. Resolve their comments 
        locally, commit, and push the suggested changes to your remote repository. 
        Your updates appear in the pull request.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Merge_your_pull_request ">
      <header><h1>Merge your pull request </h1></header>
      <p>Before you merge, you may have to resolve merge conflicts if others have made 
        changes to the repo. When your pull request is approved and conflict-free, you 
        can add your code to the master branch. Merge from the pull request in Github.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Pull_requests">
      <header><h1>Pull requests</h1></header>
      <p>Aside from isolating feature development, branches make it possible to discuss 
        changes via pull requests. Once someone completes a feature, they don’t immediately 
        merge it into <i>master</i>. Instead, they push the feature branch to the central 
        server and file a pull request asking to merge their additions into <i>master</i>. 
        This gives other developers an opportunity to review the changes before they become 
        a part of the main codebase.</p>
      <p>Code review is a major benefit of pull requests, but they’re actually designed to 
        be a generic way to talk about code. You can think of pull requests as a discussion 
        dedicated to a particular branch. This means that they can also be used much earlier 
        in the development process. For example, if a developer needs help with a particular 
        feature, all they have to do is file a pull request. Interested parties will be 
        notified automatically, and they’ll be able to see the question right next to the 
        relevant commits.</p>
      <p>Once a pull request is accepted, the actual act of publishing a feature is much 
        the same as in the 
        <i><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows">Centralized 
          Workflow</a></i>. First, you need to make sure your local <i>master</i> is 
          synchronized with the upstream <i>master</i>. Then, you merge the feature branch 
          into <i>master</i> and push the updated master back to the central repository.</p>
