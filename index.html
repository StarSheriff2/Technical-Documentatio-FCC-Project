      <p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during 
        software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it 
        can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data 
        integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>

      <header><h1>Introduction to Github workflow</h1></header>
      <p>The guide assumes you already understand what Git is and what it's used for.</p>
      <p>It assumes you already know how to create a repository using Github and clone it to your 
        local machine directory</p>
      <p>The core idea behind the <strong>Feature Branch Workflow</strong> is that all feature development should take 
        place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy 
        for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. 
        It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for 
        continuous integration environments.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="How_it_works">
      <header><h1>How it works</h1></header>
      <p>The <strong>Feature Branch Workflow</strong> assumes a central repository, and <i>master</i> represents the 
        official project history. Instead of committing directly on their local master branch, 
        developers create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature. Feature branches 
        should have descriptive names, like animated-menu-items or issue-#1061. The idea is to give 
        a clear, highly-focused purpose to each branch.</p>
      <p>In addition, feature branches can (and should) be pushed to the central repository. This 
        makes it possible to share a feature with other developers without touching any official 
        code. Since <i>master</i> is the only “special” branch, storing several feature branches on the 
        central repository doesn’t pose any problems. Of course, this is also a convenient way to 
        back up everybody’s local commits. The following is a walk-through of the <strong>life-cycle of a 
        feature branch</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Start_with_the_master_branch">
      <header><h1>Start with the master branch</h1></header>
      <p>All feature branches are created off the latest code state of a project. This guide assumes 
        this is maintained and updated in the <i>master</i> branch.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code> 
            git checkout master</code></li>
          <li><code> 
            git fetch origin</code></li>
          <li><code> 
            git reset --hard origin/master</code></li>
        </ul>
      <p>This switches the repo to the master branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's 
        local copy of master to match the latest version.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Create_a_new-branch">
      <header><h1>Create a new-branch</h1></header>
      <p>Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on. After creating a branch, check 
        it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.</p>
      <code>&nbsp git checkout -b new-feature</code>
      <p>This checks out a branch called new-feature based on master, and the -b flag tells Git to 
        create the branch if it doesn’t already exist.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Update_add_commit_and_push_changes">
      <header><h1>Update, add, commit, and push changes</h1></header>
      <p>On this branch, edit, stage, and commit changes in the usual fashion, building up the 
        feature with as many commits as necessary. Work on the feature and make commits like you 
        would any time you use Git.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code> 
          git status</code></li>
        <li><code> 
          git add</code></li>
        <li><code> 
          git commit</code></li>
      </ul>
